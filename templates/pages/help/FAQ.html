# Frequently Asked Questions

### No pressure sensitivity

First, make sure you have the Wintab drivers installed. If you have the
drivers, but pressure still doesn't work, try the 32 bit version.

Also, try enabling "bug workaround mode" in the preferences dialog.

### Wonky/unusable lines when using a graphics tablet

This problem is most likely caused by an incompatibility between Qt and the
graphics tablet driver. Try enabling "bug workarounds" in the preferences dialog.
If that fails, you can disable tablet support entirely.
This causes Drawpile to treat the tablet like a mouse, meaning invalid data in the tablet
events get ignored. A downside is that you will also lose support for stylus pressure sensitivity.

Version 2.0.5 includes a built-in tablet test tool (under the *Help* menu)
that may help with diagnosing tablet related problems. 

### "Connection timed out" when connecting

A "connection timed out" error (when you know the server should be up) is typically caused by firewalls.

Another common cause is trying to connect to a 1.x server using a 2.x client.

First, check that the hosting user is not behind a NAT. Drawpile can use UPnP,
which is supported by most home routers, to automatically set up port forwarding.
If the port forwarding works, the private IP address displayed in the status bar
(typically starts with 10. or 192.) gets replaced by the public address a few seconds after the session is started.

If the address does not change, you must set up port forwarding manually.
See the [hosting](/help/hosting/) page for more info.

Note. If the public address starts with "100.64.", it means your ISP doesn't
have enough addresses to go around and you're behind carrier-grade NAT.
In this case, you must use a remote server to host. (Or use an IPv6 address, if available.)

If you're sure NAT is not the problem, check if the operating system's firewall
is not blocking Drawpile's port (27750 by default.) This includes the standard
firewall as well as any 3rd party firewalls.

### Cannot export video: ffmpeg executable not found

This message is shown in the video export dialog if Ffmpeg is not found.
Ffmpeg can be downloaded at [ffmpeg.org](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).
Set the path to the ffmpeg executable in Drawpile's preferences dialog.

### Can I use Drawpile on my Android tablet or iPad?

An Android port should be technically possible and may be created in the future.
(The limiting factor being developer time.)

An iOS version is unfeasible, however, as the App Store terms of service are
not compatible with the license used by Drawpile and many of the libraries
it depends on.
