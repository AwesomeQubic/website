## I found a bug

You can report bugs at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/drawpile/Drawpile/issues/).

When making a bug report, please include all the relevant detail that you can.
A one liner such as "Feature X doesn't work" will be followed up by me asking
"how doesn't it work?", so please preempt that question by explaining the bug in
more detail.

Step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce the bug would be immensely
helpful, but I recognize that this is not always possible.

## I have a feature request

You can also submit feature requests at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/drawpile/Drawpile/issues/).

If you're requesting several unrelated features, please make a new issue for each one.
This helps me keep track of them all. When many features are lumped together in a single
issue, it's very easy to forget about the others after one has been implemented.

## Website related bug reports and feature requests

Requests related to this website should go to the [website's issue tracker](https://github.com/drawpile/website/issues).
