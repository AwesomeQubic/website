# Joining a drawing session

<p class="has-text-centered">{% include "components/image.html" with name="joindialog.png" alt="[join dialog screenshot]" %}</p>

To join a session, select the **Join** action from the *Session* menu.

You will see a list of sessions announced at a listing server (drawpile.net) or a list of servers running
on the local network (Nearby.)

Click on the lock button to show password protected sessions. The second button shows sessions that
have been tagged as NSFW.

You can enter a whole session URL, a server address or a room code to join.

Clicking on the record button next to the address box will allow you to capture the sessions history from the very
beginning.

It may take some time to get up to speed with the session.
If you start drawing and your strokes disappear, it is probably because you haven't caught up yet.
The strokes will reappear once the whole session has been synchronized.
