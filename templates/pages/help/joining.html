# Joining a drawing session

<p class="has-text-centered">{% include "components/image.html" with name="joindialog.png" alt="[join dialog screenshot]" %}</p>

To join a session, select the **Join** action from the *Session* menu.

You will see a list of sessions from servers you have added, as well as servers running on the local network (Nearby) if you have Bonjour installed.
You can find servers to add by visiting the [communities](/communities/) page. Enter the server's address and click the <em>Add Server</em> button
to add it to the list. Note that not all servers provide the listing functionality.

You can enter a whole session URL, a server address or a room code to join.

Clicking on the record button next to the address box will allow you to capture the sessions history from the very
beginning.

It may take some time to get up to speed with the session.
If you start drawing and your strokes disappear, it is probably because you haven't caught up yet.
The strokes will reappear once the whole session has been synchronized.
